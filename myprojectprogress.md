 ## My Project Progress
Lets do open source banking! I have no clue how but if the open source development process
can beat out Microsoft and Apple then why can't it beat Bank of America? ... or maybe something
more simple...
I dont know if blessed or common would be better. I've used common before and it worked well enough
with 4 people... I feel like blessed would require a dedicated/talented leader... then again
common probably needs strong organization too to keep people from stepping all over eachother.
